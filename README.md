### Â© @simy46, 2024

## Project Description
**CANSLIM_SERVER** is the backend server for the CANSLIM Calculator application, designed to implement the investment principles from *"How to Make Money in Stocks Getting Started: A Guide to Putting CAN SLIM Concepts into Action"* by Matthew Galgani. The server handles requests from the front-end, fetches data from external APIs, processes it, and sends back the necessary information to evaluate the investment potential of stocks based on the CAN SLIM criteria.
